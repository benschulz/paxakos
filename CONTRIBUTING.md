# Contributing to Paxakos

Hi there, you're looking to contribute? Awesome! Any contributions are highly
welcome, especially bug reports, feedback on the API and ideas for improvement.

Before you invest a lot of time and file a pull request, please be aware that

 - Paxakos is a very young project and many decisions haven't been made or
   finalized yet. It is possible that your PR will be rejected because it does
   not align with the direction of the project. Please open an issue first.
 - Paxakos is currently licensed under GPLv3. However, this is another decision
   that isn't final yet. As such you will be asked to assign the copyright to
   me before I can merge it.
